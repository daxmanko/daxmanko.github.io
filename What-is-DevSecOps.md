How may DevSecOps be described? 

 * DevSecOps is a composition of enhanced “engineering” practices that reduce lead time and increase the frequency of delivery.  
 * DevSecOps is a mindset, culture, and a set of technical practices. It provides communication, integration, automation, and close cooperation among all the people needed to plan, develop, test, secure, deploy, release, and maintain a system​.  
 * DevSecOps is the seamless integration of security testing and protection through the software development and deployment lifecycle.​  
 * The goal of DevSecOps is “Release on Demand”.  This is accomplished by implementing an increasingly Automated Continuous Delivery Pipeline.

## The Software Factory
Technology delivery processes are traditionally reliant on teams with opposing goals and incentives​

 * Agile teams must deliver changes quickly to keep pace with business needs.​
 * Operations teams must regulate the flow of changes to maintain the stability of solutions that run the business. ​
 * Security teams must institute policies to prevent changes from introducing vulnerabilities that can cause data breaches. ​

To correct this, a new delivery system is needed — a ‘software factory’ that aligns teams and increases delivery speed while simultaneously increasing solution quality, security, and stability. Only then can the needs of all teams and the needs of the customer be met predictably and effectively. **The SW Factory enables the Continuous Delivery Pipeline.**

## SAFe = Agile & DevSecOps
SAFe is based on four primary bodies of knowledge:  

 * Agile Development
 * Lean Product Development
 * Systems Thinking
 * DevSecOps

> A learning cycle that allows teams to establish one or more hypotheses, build a solution to test them and learn from that work

Through PIs & Iterations, teams continuously:​

1. Explore user value​
2. Integrate & Demo value​
3. Continuously deploy to production​
4. Release value whenever the business needs it
